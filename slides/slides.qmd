## Poll üôãüèª {.text-lime-cyan}

- What are you hoping to learn today?
- How comfortable do you feel with R and ggplot2?

# [Improving]{.hl .hl-gold} your plots {.text-wash-black background="linear-gradient(45deg, #f37335, #fdc830)"}

## Who is it for? {.text-orange-gold .center style="text-align:center"}

A lot of data vis advice is just communication advice!
<br><br>
**Who** is your plot for?

**What** do you need them to know or do?

**When and how** will they see your plot?

What are they likely to **know already?**

## What will your readers see first? {.text-orange-gold .center style="text-align:center"}

Information designers call this **visual hierarchy**.
<br><br>
What did you see first on this slide? What did you see second?

Why?

## {.center style="text-align:center"}

When all of the elements on your plot look the same, it's really hard for people to decide what to focus on. Without that focus, it's difficult for your plot to lead to a conclusion. Instead, you want to vary your plot elements, drawing attention to the most important things first. There are lots of ways to do this: bolding text, making it bigger, using colours, and taking advantage of natural reading direction can all help to establish visual hierarchy.

## Reading direction

Left-to-right?

Right-to-left?

Top-to-bottom?

This might depend on your audience!

## Combining these elements
<br><br>

[Visual hierarchy can help]{style="font-size:125%; color: #dd0033; font-weight: bold;"}

And we have many ways to build it

[James made this slide, but that's less important]{style="font-size:75%; color: #bbbbbb"}

## Combining these elements

:::{.callout-tip}
You can also use these elements against each other to fine-tune your visual hierarchy, but you need to make sure you don't make things too confusing!

## When to draw things, and when not to {.text-orange-gold .center style="text-align:center"}

Some data vis practitioners refer to a principle called the **data-to-ink ratio**
<br><br>
The idea is to minimise the amount of "ink" for the amount of data you're trying to convey.

## When to draw things, and when not to {.text-orange-gold .center style="text-align:center"}

It's definitely possible to take this principle **too far**‚Äîsometimes redundancy can be helpful for people!
<br><br>
But it's always worth asking the **purpose plot elements serve**, and whether your plot has a focus or is **too busy**

## When to draw things, and when not to {.text-orange-gold .center style="text-align:center"}

If your plot has too many things, or is **trying to tell multiple stories at once**, think about how you can help readers **build up** to that complexity:

:::::{style="margin-top: 100px"}
::::{.columns style="font-size: 75%;"}
:::{.column width="30%"}
Use animation to introduce elements one at a time
:::
:::{.column width="30%"}
Make more than one plot
:::

:::{.column width="30%"}
De-emphasise less important info or emphasise more important info

# [[Exercise 1:]{.hl-purple}<br>Time series data]{style="color:white"} { background="linear-gradient(45deg, #4a00e0, #ff0099)"}

## Exercise 1 {.text-indigo-pink .center}

Open the `exercises/exercises.qmd` file

<br>
This notebook compares **peak electricity demand** each day to **maximum temperature** at **3 sites**
<br><br>
We'll split into groups and try to make a better plot **for publication**
<br><br>
Start by **discussing improvements** you'd make. If you know R, **try making these changes!** If not, I have some suggestions you can copy further down üòâ

# [[Exercise 2:]{.hl-red}<br>maps]{style="color:white"} { background="linear-gradient(45deg, #ed213a, #93291e)"}

## Exercise 2 {.text-red-brown .center}

Continue down `exercises/exercises.qmd` file to Exercise 2

<br>
This notebook shows **temperatures across Australia** over the course of two hot days.
<br><br>
We also have data on reigons in New South Wales.
<br><br>
Think about the kinds of questions you could answer with this data.

Start by **discussing improvements** you'd make. If you know R, **try making these changes!** If not, I have some suggestions you can copy further down üòâ

# Thank you for having me!

Thanks **Mat Lipson** and the [**NEAR program**](https://near.csiro.au/) (BOM + CSIRO) for our time series data, and [**Copernicus**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) and the [**ABS**](https://abs.gov.au) for the map data!
